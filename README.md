# Fruit-Builder
A basic stub builder that makes .pyc stubs.
Dont know what a .pyc file is? Its a compiled python script. I havent seen many stubs compile into a .pyc so i made one!

# Steps For Instalation.

1. Install as a Zip
2. Extract all files
3. Run setup.bat to install the dependencies
4. Run Fruit_Builder.pyc
5. Allow Admin Perms.
6. Toggle all the options you want
7. Click Compiler
8. Put your webhook inside there
9. Press the Compile button
10. Rename the temp.cpython file to whatever you want.

# Why Use Fruit Builder

1. It install all the dependencies inside of the .pyc file for victims
2. It compiles inside of .pyc files
3. All the options work, besides the Icon, because you cant add an icon to .pyc files
4. Your supporting me <3
5. I like 5 reasons :D
