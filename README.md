# Fruit-Builder
A basic stub builder that makes .pyc stubs.
Dont know what a .pyc file is? Its a compiled python script. I havent seen many stubs compile into a .pyc so i made one!

#Prerequisiqtes
Python 3 (any version)

# Steps For Instalation.

# Why Use Fruit Builder

1. It install all the dependencies inside of the .pyc file for victims
2. It compiles inside of .pyc files
3. All the options work, besides the Icon, because you cant add an icon to .pyc files
4. Your supporting me <3
